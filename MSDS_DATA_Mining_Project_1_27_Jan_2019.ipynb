Gender of newborns, location of residence, gestational age (either in weeks or days), parity and maternal age were considered by the study authors as effect modifiers; location of residence was related to three categories of average annual income: low income (500,000 to 1 million Chilean pesos), middle income (1 to 1.5 million Chilean pesos) and high income (more than 1.5 million Chilean pesos).
